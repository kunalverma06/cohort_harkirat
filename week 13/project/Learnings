when you are using cloud you should not use local database

Connection pool is required as the machines which run your code are running are not one but multiples so they  shouldnot directly access to the database , so we use connection pool

When you are using cloud , avoid as much global variable (outside the function/ route) cuz one fucntion is running on one machine so you might loose the access of the global variables
